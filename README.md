All files are Matlab scipts, used under MATLAB 9.6, R2019a.

The main Monte Carlo calculation is done in replaceAll2.m. Note that since no explicit initialization of the random number generator is specified, each run will yield slightly and immaterially different results.

The main paper's Figs. 1-3 are generated by plReplace2_1/2/3.m respectively.
